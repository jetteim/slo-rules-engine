# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository is a public-safe SLO rules engine.

It models provider-independent reliability intent in a Ruby DSL, generates provider-specific observability artifacts, and is being deepened into an explicit provider-state management engine with `diff`, `import`, `apply`, and `prune`.

## Current Priority Order

1. Provider-state deepening
2. Telemetry-first onboarding path
3. Provider breadth and telemetry-first scale after the baseline is solid

The current stream is provider-state deepening. Do not switch to telemetry-first work until the current provider-state checkpoint is at a safe commit/push boundary.

## Non-Negotiable Working Rules

- Keep the repo public-safe. Private/internal rules are reference material only and must not be copied in.
- Prefer the existing neutral DSL and provider contract over provider-specific policy.
- Commit and push often.
- Add verification evidence before claiming a checkpoint is complete.
- Update this file when a checkpoint materially changes current priorities, recent checkpoints, or the next recommended slice.

## Current State Summary

Implemented and already pushed:

- Neutral Ruby DSL, model, validation, provider registry
- Datadog / Prometheus stack / Sloth generation
- Telemetry lookup, discovery baseline, candidates, draft-definition, reality checks
- Reviewed manifest flow
- `diff`, `import`, `apply`, `prune`
- Provider contract enforcement
- Manifest schema validation
- Datadog payload validation before live mutation
- Drift-aware Datadog apply (`noop` when state already matches)
- Drift-aware manifest-bundle apply (`noop` when file already matches)
- Datadog import findings for missing expected resources
- Datadog prune based on service-scoped managed orphan discovery
- Datadog import findings for orphan managed resources
- Datadog dashboard ownership tags and tag-based managed-state discovery
- Datadog source-tag reconciliation for `existing_state`, `import`, and `prune` when backend names drift
- Datadog managed-tag validation and unmanaged-tag canonicalization during reconciliation
- Datadog SLO and monitor field-contract validation before live mutation
- Datadog counter-ratio `time_slice` SLO translation, validation, and diff reconciliation
- Datadog threshold-based `time_slice` SLO translation for provider query expressions with reviewed `success_threshold`
- Datadog dashboard evidence queries now merge reviewed selector scope into provider query expressions
- Datadog threshold-based distribution and gauge `time_slice` SLOs can infer provider queries from reviewed metric bindings when explicit query text is absent
- Datadog threshold-based counter `time_slice` SLOs can infer traffic-floor queries from reviewed metric bindings when explicit query text is absent
- Datadog dashboard payloads now validate the generated template-variable and note/timeseries widget contract explicitly
- Datadog payload readers now prefer hash keys over colliding Ruby methods such as `Hash#default`
- `diff`, `apply`, and `prune` plans now emit shared change-impact summaries with total, actionable, destructive, action, and target counts
- Datadog state plans now flag recreate and prune-delete operations with provider-specific risk levels and reasons
- Datadog import and state plans now preserve `match_identity` evidence and flag weaker name/title fallback matches explicitly
- Live Datadog `update` and `recreate` mutations are now blocked when ownership was matched without managed `source_ref` identity

## Current Open Gaps

Highest-value remaining provider-state gaps:

1. Remaining Datadog resource semantics not yet validated against the real backend contract, especially any provider-owned fields still treated heuristically
2. Broader state-management parity for future providers after the Datadog baseline is stronger
3. Decide whether low-confidence ownership should also block prune or remain advisory there

Secondary gaps:

1. Batch telemetry discovery across service portfolios and selector inputs
2. Candidate confidence and saved evidence packets for telemetry-derived drafts
3. Service onboarding summary that ranks discovered services and signals by review readiness

## Recommended Next Slice

Next recommended provider-state slice:

- tighten remaining Datadog backend-contract semantics and decide whether low-confidence ownership should also block prune or remain advisory there

Rationale:

- the shared change-impact summary baseline now exists across `diff`, `apply`, and `prune`
- provider-specific risk signaling now exists for recreate and prune-delete operations
- weaker identity matches are now explicit in import and plan output
- live Datadog `update` and `recreate` now enforce managed source identity
- the next remaining provider-state value is deciding whether prune should use the same enforcement threshold
- Datadog is still the reference live provider, so its remaining contract gaps should be closed before widening other providers

## Verification Commands

Use these before claiming a checkpoint:

```bash
ruby -Ilib test/datadog_apply_test.rb
ruby -Ilib test/cli_test.rb
ruby -Ilib test/all_test.rb
ruby -Ilib test/forbidden_terms_test.rb
./scripts/verify.sh
git status --short --branch
```

## Resume Checklist

If a new session needs to resume quickly:

1. Read this file
2. Read `docs/implementation-plan.md`
3. Read `docs/adoption-map.md`
4. Read the latest 5-10 commits on `main`
5. Inspect `lib/slo_rules_engine/appliers/datadog.rb`
6. Continue the highest-priority open slice listed above
